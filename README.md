# Math 118 Extra Credit

This is my extra credit assignment for Math 118. 

For my assignment, I decided to implement my own multinomial logistic regression model from scratch to show how multinomial logistic regression works (since we covered binary logistic regression in class), as well as show ways that we can increase model accuracy (through hyperparameter tuning). We will implement both gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent to show how these two optimization algorithms can optimize the cost function of logistic regression (cross-entropy loss) and compare the accuracy between the two to see if one performs better than the other.

We will use the Census dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult).
