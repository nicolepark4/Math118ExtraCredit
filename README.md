# Math 118 Extra Credit
### Nicole Park, UID: 705385536, Date: 12/2/2022

This is my extra credit assignment for Math 118. 

For my assignment, I decided to implement my own multinomial logistic regression model from scratch to show how multinomial logistic regression works (since we covered binary logistic regression in class), as well as show ways that we can increase model accuracy (through hyperparameter tuning). We will implement stochastic gradient descent to show how these two optimization algorithms can optimize the cost function of logistic regression (cross-entropy loss) and compare the accuracy between our own model and sklearn's LogisticRegression function to see how the mdoel accuracy compares.

We will use the Dermatology dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/dermatology).

The dataset has also been uploaded as a csv file ("dermatology.csv") for convenience.

The implementation of the model can be found in the ipynb file ("NicoleParkMath118ExtraCredit.ipynb") along with explanations of the theory.
